This project aims to gather weather data from a public API, perform analysis on the data, and visualize it using Python. Users can input a location or use predefined locations, and the application will fetch historical weather data for that location. It will then analyze the data to provide insights such as average temperature, precipitation trends, and temperature variations over time. Finally, it will generate visualizations such as line charts, histograms, and heatmaps to present the data in an understandable format.
