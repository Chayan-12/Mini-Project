1.1. Problem Definition


In the realm of modern healthcare, the pursuit of personalized medicine has
emerged as a paramount objective. In this context, our client, a leading
healthcare organization, recognizes the pressing need to develop a
personalized medication recommendation system based on patient health
records. The client's motivation stems from the limitations inherent in
traditional healthcare approaches, which often rely on generalized treatment
guidelines rather than considering the unique characteristics and needs of
individual patients. By harnessing the power of patient health records and
cutting-edge technologies, the client seeks to revolutionize healthcare delivery,
optimize therapeutic interventions, and enhance patient outcomes.
