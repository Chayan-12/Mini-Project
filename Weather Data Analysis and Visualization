Description:
This project aims to gather weather data from a public API, perform analysis on the data, and visualize it using Python. Users can input a location or use predefined locations, and the application will fetch historical weather data for that location. It will then analyze the data to provide insights such as average temperature, precipitation trends, and temperature variations over time. Finally, it will generate visualizations such as line charts, histograms, and heatmaps to present the data in an understandable format.

Features:

-Fetch historical weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
-Allow users to input their desired location or select from predefined locations.
-Analyze the weather data to calculate various statistics like average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation levels, etc.
-Visualize the data using popular Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
-Provide interactive visualizations that allow users to explore the data dynamically.
-Include error handling for invalid inputs and API requests.
-Document the project with clear instructions on how to set up the environment and run the application.


Technologies:

-Python
-Requests library for API requests
-Pandas for data manipulation
-Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization


Steps to Implement:

-Set up a new repository on GitHub.
-Create a Python virtual environment for the project.
-Install necessary dependencies like requests, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly.
-Design the structure of your project, including modules for fetching data, data analysis, and visualization.
-Implement functions to fetch weather data from the API.
-Write code to analyze the data and calculate relevant statistics.
-Develop visualization components to present the data in meaningful ways.
-Test your code thoroughly, ensuring it handles different scenarios gracefully.
-Write clear documentation explaining how to use the application and its functionalities.
-Commit your code to GitHub and push it to your repository.
-Consider adding a README file with project details, instructions, and examples.
